# VirtualTwins

An adaptation of VirtualTwins method from [Foster, J. C., Taylor, J. M.G. and Ruberg, S. J. (2011)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.4322/abstract)

VirtualTwins is a method of subgroup identification from randomized clinical trial data.

As an intern in a french pharmaceutical group, i worked on this method and develop a package based on Jared Foster and al method.

##Â Infos 

Currently this package works for RCT with two treatments groups and binary outcome.

This is the *dev version 0.0.0.2* and often updated.

Most of the package use Reference Class programing (in R). Feel free to create your own classes.

I got a *WARNING* when Checking package for "cheking PDF version of manual" because of my version of LaTeX. Need to fix it.
